# DNA Tracking and Analysis with Trackpy and Bootstrapping
This code uses trackpy to analyse footages of DNA. It produces a MSD graph, an effective diffusion coefficient, an alpha value, and a CSV file of the MSD value for each of the video.

### Code Included (All Thoroughly Commented):
- bootstrap4tp.ipynb
  - This is the block of code used for bootstrapping in our tracking code. Bootstrapping produces a standard deviation for each data point in the dataset. It can be easily adapted for uses other than Trackpy.
- graph_maker_3.py
  - This the code we used to produce the graphs.
- trackpy_rev_5.py
  - This is the code we use to analyse footages in batches.
